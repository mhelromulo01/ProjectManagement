Aside from pork, you can use beef, shrimp or any kind you like and just add any vegetables of your choice.

Ingredients :

25g butter
½ small onion
, finely chopped
50g plain flour
250ml milk
140g sliced smoked ham, diced
50g mature cheddar, coarsely grated
50g Gruyère
, finely grated
1 tsp Dijon mustard
2 tbsp double cream
For the coating
2 large eggs
50g plain flour
140g fine dried breadcrumbs
sunflower oil, for deep frying
For the tomato chilli jam
300g ripe tomatoes
, roughly chopped
1 long red chilli, finely chopped (deseeded if you don't like it too hot)
1 small red onion, finely chopped
4 large garlic cloves, crushed
100g demerara sugar
100ml red wine vinegar

Cooking Procedures:

1. To make the croquetas, melt the butter in a medium saucepan and gently fry the onion for 3 mins or until lightly coloured. Stir in the flour and cook for 30 secs. Gradually add the milk, stirring constantly, and cook over a low heat for 5 mins until thick and glossy. Stir in the ham, cheese, mustard and cream, and season to taste. Cook for 1 min more until the cheese melts, stirring constantly.
2. Pour into a bowl and cover the surface with cling film to stop a skin forming. Leave to cool, then chill for 4 hrs or overnight - the mixture needs to be very stiff to form the croquetas. Take heaped teaspoons of the mixture and, with wet hands, roll into 24 small oval shapes and put on a tray. Beat the eggs in a shallow bowl, put the flour on a plate and half of the breadcrumbs in a bowl.
3. Roll each of the croquetas lightly in flour, then in egg before coating in breadcrumbs. Place on a baking tray lined with baking parchment. Use the remaining breadcrumbs to top up the bowl halfway through the coating process. Chill for 30 mins (or to freeze, see tip, below left).

Using a metal slotted spoon, lower 6 croquets into the oil and cook for 1.5 mins or until golden brown. Transfer to a baking tray lined with kitchen paper to absorb excess oil, and continue cooking the rest. Serve with the chilli jam for dipping.
