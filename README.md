Nilagang Baboy (Boiled Pork with Vegetables)

My family loves nilaga like this nilagang baboy. This type of recipe are soupy kind of food dish and if we have this recipe on our table, my kids quickly finish their meal and ready to go to their next activity, which is playing.

Anyways, Nilaga in filipino means ‘boiled’ and one of them is this Nilagang Baboy which is another filipino recipe that is easy to make that you just throw everything in the pot and let it cook until tender. Aside from pork, you can use beef, shrimp or any kind you like and just add any vegetables of your choice.
